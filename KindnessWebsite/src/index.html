<h1>About the Kindness APP</h1>
	<p>In todays world with all the meanness going on it is hard to have faith in humanity. We read stories on 
	news websites on the internet about all kinds of crimes being committed all over the world along with
	people getting ripped off by someone else. At times we may even witness these things ourselves. This
	app is designed to help restore faith in humanity!!!</p>
