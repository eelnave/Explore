Communication Protocol (HTTP)

The Kindness Application will be operating on a client
to server relationship through Post and Get request. It
will be operating on port 80.

The client will open up the application and will be provided
with a menu that has the categories, the application's title,
and a map button.

Once a category is selected, the client is sent to a submit
button. They will be provided the information that will be
given to the server, including category, date, and location
by latitude and longitude. Pressing the submit button will
send the data to the server through a post request method.

When the server receives a new submission, it will add a
report_id to easily organize it.

If the client presses the map button, a get request will be
sent to the server and the server will return any submissions
received within the last week. This information will be translated
into icons on a map that will show where kindness has been found
(latitude and longitude) and what category it was (based on color).
