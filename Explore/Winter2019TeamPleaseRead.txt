Welcome to the Explore App!
We've really fallen in love with the idea of this app and hope you do too as you continue to develop it this semester.
We started this app from scratch and some of us felt a little overwhelmed jumping into the world of Android. There's a lot
of new concepts and ideas. We were trying to work with other people's code and online tutorials while simultaneously trying
to make this app amazing. We decided that we wanted to help you get off to a more succesful start. That's why we spent our
last two weeks refactoring our codebase to make it more understandable and adding in comments that hopefully provide helpful
tutorials on how each line of code is working. Before jumping into these comments I'd recommend spending some time working
with and understanding XML so that you can better understand how the views created there are interacting with the Java code
we've created. This app is yours now so feel free to inject your own creativity and to change and fiddle with any of the code
we've written. We're excited to see what you turn this app into!
